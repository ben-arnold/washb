\title{Estimate linear combinations of GLM regression coefficients.}
\usage{
washb_lincom(lc = NULL, fit, vcv, measure = "RR", flag = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lc}{: Index vector of coefficients from glm modellinear combination of coefficients}

\item{fit}{: Model object returned from coeftest (class=coeftest) command within the washb_glm function. Accessed with $fit from washb_glm output.}

\item{vcv}{: variance-covariance matrix of coefficients. Accessed with $vcv from washb_glm output.}

\item{measure}{measure of effect. RR = risk ratio, RD = risk difference}

\item{flag}{Internal argument used to flag and suppress printing if the washb_lincom function is called within another function.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of the risk ratios or risk differences, the variance-covariance matrix, and a vector indexing the rows of observations
        used to fit the glm model
}
\description{
Function to get Estimates, SEs, CIs, and P-values for Pr>|Z| from a linear combination of regression coefficients.

# merge the baseline dataset to the follow-up dataset
ad <- merge(washb_bangladesh_enrol,washb_bangladesh_diar,by=c("dataid","clusterid","block","tr"),all.x=FALSE,all.y=TRUE)

# subset to the relevant measurement
# Year 1 or Year 2
ad <- subset(ad,svy==1|svy==2)

#subset the diarrhea to children <36 mos at enrollment
### (exlude new births that are not target children)
ad <- subset(ad,sibnewbirth==0)
ad <- subset(ad,gt36mos==0)

# Exclude children with missing data
ad <- subset(ad,!is.na(ad$diar7d))

#Re-order the tr factor for convenience
ad$tr <- factor(ad$tr,levels=c("Control","Water","Sanitation","Handwashing","WSH","Nutrition","Nutrition + WSH"))

#Ensure that month is coded as a factor
ad$month <- factor(ad$month)

#Sort the data for perfect replication when using V-fold cross-validation
ad <- ad[order(ad$block,ad$clusterid,ad$dataid,ad$childid),]

#Create one column dataframe holding the subgroup variable
W_tchild <- subset(ad, select=tchild)

#Estimate subgroup analysis glm with washb_glm
glm.C.N.byChildType <- washb_glm(Y=ad$diar7d,tr=ad$tr,pair=ad$block, V="tchild", id=ad$clusterid, contrast=c("Control","Nutrition"), family=binomial(link='log'), print=FALSE)


#The lincom function is called within washb_glm, so for standard subgroup analysis, there is no need to use the lincom()
#function separately. But it can be used on its own to create a custom combination of regression coefficients


#Examine the treatment effect across subgroups with `objectname'$lincom
glm.C.N.byChildType$lincom

#Below is an example of using the `lincom()` function to externally replicate the target child/sibling subgroup analysis of the diarrheal disease outcome. First, recall the glm model contrasting diarrheal disease prevalence ratio between target child and sibling fitted to diarrheal disease:
#Use the lincom function to verify the subgroup analysis calculated within the `washb_glm()` function. `washb_lincom()` takes as argements the fit and variance-covariance matrix returned by the glm function, and an index vector `lc`.
#`lc`= vector indexing coefficients to be linearly combined. If a single coefficient is chosen, it will return the same coefficient and confidence interval as the glm coefficient. Example:
#Create lc vector of 0's equal in length to the number of coefficients from the glm model.
lc=rep(0,nrow(glm.C.N.byChildType$fit))
#Examine model coefficients (minus the pair-matched block estimates) to determine the position of coefficients to combine.
glm.C.N.byChildType$fit[1:6,]
#Replace the second and fourth position in the vector with 1 (the positions of the treatment coefficient and interaction term in the model)
lc[c(2,4)]<-1

#Run the lincom function and compare output to the $lincom output from the GLM model.
washb_lincom(lc=lc,fit=glm.C.N.byChildType$fit,vcv=glm.C.N.byChildType$vcv, measure="RR")
